# Analyser - Markdown Parser

_Analyser [analize] - to analyze something_

Analyser includes ```MarkDownParserCore``` and ```BlockRenderer``` modules. ```MarkDownParserCore``` parses a specific subset of the markdown format. Full details of the markdown format can be found from the [open source guide](https://www.markdownguide.org).

```MarkDownParserCore``` provides  ```[Block]``` type output and ```BlockRenderer``` transforms the blocks into ```NSAttributedStrings```.

This package is developed to support content distribution for Camping Finland iOS app.
